<p>In August 2021, I&rsquo;m planning to go on a cruise with Ryan, Sara and Jess. It is an Alaskan Cruise departing from Seattle US and visiting parts of Alaska and Canada. The main part of the holiday is sight-seeing. Glaciers, Whales and everything Alaska has to offer.</p>
<p>In order to have the best possible time, I'm trying to get some financial support. I would be eternally grateful if you could support my holiday in any way you can.</p>

<p>For Chritsmas or my birthday, if you usually get me a gift or a card, perhaps this year you could consider giving towards one of my planned excursions instead? Whatever you can help with, even just the &pound;1 you might have spent on a card would be amazing to chip away at cost!</p>
<p>We're planning the following excursions. If you decide to, you can select which of these you would like to support.</p>
