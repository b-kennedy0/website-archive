## Top 10 Apps for Postgraduates - Work Smarter, Not Harder

Whether you're about to start study, near the start, half way through or nearing the end - this article is for you! 
​​

At a recent conference I was talking with some fellow PhD students about their work and their day-to-day, it was then I realised I had been suggesting apps and software to nearly everybody I spoke to. This made me think that perhaps not everybody knows about all the super cool apps I take for granted each and every day. Hence the creation of this post. 

While this is a list of 10, you may not use all of them. Hopefully, even if you don't use all of these, one or two may interest you. If you use just one and it makes your work less strenuous, then my job has been done! 

So, lets begin! ...... psssstt Click the numbers to go to the App!

​​
#01 Adobe Fill & Sign
This is a key one. If you get sent documents and forms to be signed or filled out (which is everybody), then this is going to help. With the ability to quick fill sections such as name, date, address with pre-saved responses. You can also save a hand signature to add that personal touch.




​​
#02 OneNote
Note taking? Of course you are. This app will allow you to take notes (and hand written notes if you have an iPad and stylus), arrange notes into sections and separate books. The added benefit of this app is that the notes sync between devices. Take notes in class/meeting on your iPad, head back to your desk and find the notes on your PC. Add onto that, the option to add collaborators, work on a document at the same time, keep to-do lists updated between working groups/lab teams.

 #03 Exchange to-do (Sync with IOS Reminders)
So most Universities are using Microsoft exchange for their email service. One of the great hidden features is their to-do lists. This is much more than a standard to-do list - you can add details of when you need to start the event, when it's due, it's priority, category and even group them by a flag colour. One of the key tips with this is to add your Exchange account to your mobile phone and enable it to sync with your reminders app. This way, you receive the mobile notifications for your tasks and can mark them as complete on-the-go. (One thing to note, you may wish to disable your emails syncing with your mobile - you do deserve weekends off!)

​​
#04 Peer US
Difficult to keep on top of your areas new research and publications? Tell me about it! Well, let Peer us do all the leg work. Its an online platform that is the smart and fast way to be told about the latest peer reviewed published articles relevant to your field. It's a self-learning tool that gets more powerful each and everyday. Every 6 hours, peer us checks for latest articles, analyses their content, matches up the content with your profile and if it is relevant to you, sends it on! No more daily (or weekly) scrounging for the newest papers and trying to filter through those that aren't relevant to you and your work. 

​​
#05 Teamviewer
For that moment at a conference, where the file you really need is back on the office computer many many miles away. This piece of software is the solution. You do need to have installed Team viewer onto your computer, signed in with an account and set up 'unattended access'. Then, installed the app on your phone/tablet, sign in and be able to access and control your computer from anywhere in the world! One caveat however is that you utilise the free version of Team viewer for this, these are for personal use only and shouldn't be use for business/productivity. If you do wish to, there are options to upgrade the plans for other features. 

​​
#06 LinkedIn
While this may seem like an obvious one, this professional social media site is the perfect forum to network and find others who may be working on similar projects or areas to you. LinkedIn often appears as one of the top five search results for your name on Google. This shows just how important it is to have this professional version of your Facebook, which you have controlled to show exactly what you need to show off to colleagues and potential future employers. Remember, use a professional photograph for your profile, this is key! A lot of a viewers impression would come from that image. 

​​
#07 Twitter
Again, a rather obvious one to most - a field related Twitter profile. As in, something separate to your personal Twitter page. Ideally, you'd want your personal page set to 'Private'. Using a Twitter for networking is great, you can follow succinct updates from those in your field of interest. And, as you become more familiar, you'll be posting your own succinct updates - great practice for quickly telling people about your work. 

​​
#08 Google Drive
This one is a little bit of a cheat for my list of 'ten'. Google Drive encompasses a few separate apps that are amazing for your work. Google's collection of software such as Sheets, Docs and Slides are great ways to collaboratively work on a single document in real-time. Plus, they offer a fairly decent storage amount on the free plan (15gb- and really competitive paid plans £15.99 for a year of 100gb). Google Drive makes it really easy to share documents and folders, easily controlling who can view and who can edit. The comment feature on Google Drive makes it really easy to give feedback, make changes and track all edits. 

​​
#09 Slack
Slack is in essence a chat software - but it is so much more than that. It gives you and your team a forum to get things done. Share ideas, share documents collaborate and just get work done. In Slack, conversations happen in channels — organised by topic, project, team, or whatever makes sense for your company. With channels, the right people don't get left out and information doesn't get lost (as often happens in long email chains). Slack also has a powerful search feature allowing you to always find what you need, quickly. Slack also integrates seamlessly with many other services like Dropbox and Google Drive. A must for lab groups!

#10 DataCamp & Mobile app
Last but not least, DataCamp and their mobile app. If you are learning coding, be it in R or Python or whatever, DataCamp offers courses for learning. These courses are well designed and learning is so quick and easy. Data camp have you working on real problems with real datasets so you get first hand experience of using the code. Some say the best way to learn is to do, and that's exactly what they do! They also have published a handy mobile app which allows you to practice some of their sessions right on your phone. This is so handy for commutes and train journeys to conferences! One thing to note, is Data camp is not free - a plan would be required but some departments may considered purchasing a license for a number of students and staff if they feel it will benefit them, so start making enquiries! 

A couple of others I didn't get to mention but would be worth checking out are Typeform, Zapier and Dropbox Paper. If you have any questions, do get in touch! 

There - that's all for now. There are games too so remember work hard, play hard!
