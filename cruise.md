In August 2021, I'm planning to go on a cruise with Ryan, Sara and Jess. It is an Alaskan Cruise departing from Seattle US and visiting parts of Alaska and Canada. The main part of the holiday is sight-seeing. Glaciers, Whales and everything Alaska has to offer. 

For my birthday this year, I would be eternally grateful if you could support my holiday in any way you can.

If you usually buy me a gift or a card, perhaps this year you could consider giving towards one of my planned excursions instead? Whatever you can help with, even just the 50p you might have spent on a card would be amazing to chip away at cost.
