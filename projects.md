# The Open Research Calendar
“Open Research Calendar ([@openresearchcal](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal))” was created as a community tool by a few of the attendees of the ‘Advanced Methods in Reproducible Science’ workshop which was organised by the University of Bristol (also known on Twitter as [#Repro2020](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Repro2020)). The idea was initially generated by attendees of #Repro2019. The tool was designed, created and beta-tested in January of 2020 and then officially launched in February 2020.

The tool was created to serve the open research community in collating worldwide open research events into one database. This translates onto a [Google Calendar](https://bit.ly/3geEV0L) ([iCal Link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/openresearchcalendar%40gmail.com/public/basic.ics)) which can be synced into a person's own personal calendar (updating as new events get added).

# Psychological Science Accelerator - PSA006
The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is a globally distributed network of psychological science laboratories, representing over 70 countries on all six populated continents, that coordinates data collection for democratically selected studies.

The mission of the PSA is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science, reducing the distance between truth about human behaviour and mental processes and our current understanding. This challenge cannot be adequately met by a single researcher or small team. Instead, the PSA attempts to meet this challenge with a distributed laboratory network that is ongoing (as opposed to time or task limited), diverse (both in terms of human subjects and participating researchers), and inclusive (welcoming ideas, contributions, study proposals, or other input from anyone in the field of psychology).
