# Student Feedback {#studentfeedback}
Student Nomination (2018)
>"Brad has been an inspiration to all students in his lab classes. He goes beyond to help everyone and makes sure we all understand. He is always there if you need help in your statistics."  

Student Nomination (2018)
>"Every lab class Brad is completely full of happiness and I can't help but enjoy his sessions. He doesn't speak down to you and proper sees you as a friend it feels."

Student Module Evaluation (2019)
>"Brad is amazing! Really helps with things you don’t understand fully and takes the time to teach them you. He talks through demos etc. Such as working on spss thoroughly and that finds me showing friends in other lab classes showing them what to do."

Student Module Evaluation (2019)
>"Brad is very helpful in lab class, he explains things well and gives constructive feedback."

Student End-of-Year Evaluation (2019)
>"I found the labs to be very useful in gaining an understanding of what was expected of me in the assessments. Without the lab class I feel I would have really struggled to gain the level of understanding I have. My lab tutor was incredibly understanding of my needs and willing to provide support as and when required."
