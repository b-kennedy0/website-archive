Student Nomination for Teaching Award (2019)
>"I enjoy coming to his lab class, he is very passionate about his work and cares a lot about our work and our understanding of the topic, he is overall just an amazing teacher and truly inspirational. He has taught me a lot about new ways to learn without it being boring as he engages with his students and is always up for a laugh."

Student Nomination for Teaching Award (2019)
>"He is so helpful and patient when teaching us all in lab classes, he has been so supportive in providing us help when we need it and explaining things thoroughly but in a way we all understand. I have been able to explain more thoroughly to some of my friends who found it hard to understand some things on SPSS and etc. because of the understanding he has given us. His lab classes are always informative as well as being fun/funny which engages us. His teaching has inspired me and aided me to get the firsts I have done."

Student Nomination for Teaching Award (2019)
>"He has been a supportive tutor throughout our first year, leading engaging lab classes and offering academic support throughout the year. He has always had time to support our assignments and provide feedback to ensure we develop. His classes are informative and fun. I think he has really aided my first year and allowed me to get the grades I have (all being 1sts due to my coherent understanding) as he has taught us content and showed us how to apply things appropriately."

Student End-of-Year Evaluation (2019)
>"I found the labs to be very useful in gaining an understanding of what was expected of me in the assessments. Without the lab class I feel I would have really struggled to gain the level of understanding I have. My lab tutor was incredibly understanding of my needs and willing to provide support as and when required."
