Currently, at the University of Chester, my main teaching areas are across the Research Methods and Skills module (PS4005) and assisting with the delivery of the Becoming a Psychological Researcher (PS5015) module. I will also be teaching Core Topics in Psychology group workshops (PS4010). I am also involved with the marking and draft reading for the above modules as well as Applications of Psychology in Education (PS4016) and Forensic Psychology (PS4019). I am also a tutor on the Work Based Learning (WBL5101) module which runs later in the academic year for Level 5 students.

Student Module Evaluation (2019)
>"Brad is amazing! Really helps with things you don’t understand fully and takes the time to teach them you. He talks through demos etc. Such as working on spss thoroughly and that finds me showing friends in other lab classes showing them what to do."

Student End-of-Year Evaluation (2019)
>"I found the labs to be very useful in gaining an understanding of what was expected of me in the assessments. Without the lab class I feel I would have really struggled to gain the level of understanding I have. My lab tutor was incredibly understanding of my needs and willing to provide support as and when required."
