## Top Tips - Classroom Engagement

While generally speaking, 'engagement'  is the act of becoming involved or involving somebody in an activity. 
Classroom engagement is slightly different. Here, we are aiming to enthuse our classroom to take part in the "learning experience". This is a multifaceted issue, and engagement is made up of many smaller parts; Intellectual engagement, physical and social engagement.  When asked, many lecturers and teaching professionals may sigh at the prospect and laugh at the idea of trying to boost engagement. So, if it's so difficult to achieve, why bother? 

Well, XX% of students prefer workshop based learning with lots of interactivity and creativity as opposed to large group lecture style learning. Evidence supports this, those who engage with their learning perform significantly higher in tests and in retention of information. 
Lets be really clear about this though, here we are simply talking about classroom engagement of those students in the room. We are not trying to boost attendance to the class - that's an entirely different can of worms. 

Why is classroom engagement important for you (the teacher)? We are always bamboozled with statistics about retention and development. How many students do we have progressing to the next year, how many students have dropped out, how may students graduate with a good degree and go on to get a good job?  

This post aims to discuss some of the tried and tested methods of classroom engagement. This shouldn't be treated as a difinitive list of methods that will work with every class in every situation. Please do bare in mind that these have worked/not worked with a select group of students in a select place. The worst part of trying to boost engagement is that there is no definitve answer and its a game of trial and error (that is most likely the reason that experienced teachers know how difficult this is!). 

Intrigue, Enthuse, Technology

Keep it simple - ever had that moment at a conference or talk where your listening and following along just fine and then BOOM, the talk goes from 1 to 100 faster than you can quietly think 'wait what'. Then, you are left sat with one of two expressions:


Jargon and technical terms thrown left, right and centre, confusing theory and words much longer than the longest word you know. I bet, in that moment, you panicked, had a moment of self-doubt that you aren't smart enough and then finally, switched off. It's inevitable! If the content is too intense, too quick and too complex, it's natural to defend ourself and switch off. Yes, we still need to teach those complex things but we need to think about it differently. The main challenge is to try to keep it simple (but not too simple) and at a pace that's working for the whole room. 
But HOW?
