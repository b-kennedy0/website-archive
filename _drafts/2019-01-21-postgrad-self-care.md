## "Take 5" ... and then another 5 - Self care and productivity for postgraduates (or anybody with a to-do list)

That time of year where you may feel 'out of control', but not in the good way! With deadlines, meetings and upcoming events, there may be quite a bit to be getting on with. It may be that about now, it seems that deadlines and expectations rule your life. It is quite common that some postgraduate students feel as though they don't have control of their day-to-day and that their work schedule determines what they can and can't do and when to do it. 
Ever had that moment where you're invited to something social and you get your calendar out to check whats going with your work? 

Giving too much of yourself to others - trying to please - not a bad thing, but in moderation

TAKE 5
1. Take action 
2. Stay true to yourself and your habits/hobbies
3. Set some new (small) goals 
4. Decide who you want to be
5. Accept that some things are beyond control
