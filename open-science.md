# What is Open Science? 
Open Science represents a new approach to the scientific process based on cooperative work and new ways of diffusing knowledge by using digital technologies and new collaborative tools ([European Commission, 2016b:33](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/node/1431#ec2016b)).  
Open Science is about extending the principles of openness to the whole research cycle (see figure 1), fostering sharing and collaboration as early as possible thus entailing a systemic change to the way science and research is done. - [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/content/what-open-science-introduction)
